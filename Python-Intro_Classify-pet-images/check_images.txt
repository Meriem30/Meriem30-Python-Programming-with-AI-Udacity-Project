Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:
YES
Note that in the result text files, it is printed as incorrectly classified (because the extracted name 'dog' is different from the dog breed 'beagle'),
The Alexnet model classified the Dog_01.jpg as:  beagle correctly.
The Vgg model classified the Dog_01.jpg as    :  beagle correctly.
The Resnet model classified the Dog_01.jpg as :  beagle correctly.

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:
No
The Alexnet model classified the Dog_01.jpg as: beagle  .BUT classified the Dog_02.jpg as: hamster (Not a dog)
The Vgg model classified the Dog_01.jpg as    : beagle  .BUT classified the Dog_02.jpg as: italian greyhound (A dog)
The Resnet model classified BOTH Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as: beagle

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:
YES. The three models classify the two 'NOT a dog' images as 'Not a dog'

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
From these results, I can say that the best model architecture is Resnet, because
It recognized the dog images and correctly classified the breed dogs (even with the rotation),
& correctly classify the not dog images as not dogs
So it answers all the objective (1 and 2) to be obtained from such a model
In other words, it outperforms the two other models when considering the two objectives
